# 🔧 Fix Landing Page Deployment Issue

## ❌ Problem

**Vercel is showing an older deployment:**
- Current Vercel deployment: Commit `497fe8d` (old)
- Latest GitHub commit: `871b164` (new with Landing page)

**Result:** The deployed site shows the login page instead of the beautiful Landing page.

---

## ✅ Solution: Deploy Latest Code

### **Option 1: Wait for Auto-Deploy (If Connected to GitHub)**

1. **Check if Vercel is connected to GitHub:**
   - Go to [vercel.com/dashboard](https://vercel.com/dashboard)
   - Click on your project
   - Go to **Settings** → **Git**
   - Should show: "Connected to GitHub" with repository `SumitAG008/insightsheet`

2. **If connected, wait 2-3 minutes:**
   - Vercel should automatically detect the new commit
   - Check **Deployments** tab for a new deployment with commit `871b164`
   - Once it shows "Ready", your Landing page will be live!

### **Option 2: Manual Redeploy (Recommended)**

Since you just pushed to GitHub, manually trigger a redeploy:

1. **Go to Vercel Dashboard:**
   - [vercel.com/dashboard](https://vercel.com/dashboard)
   - Click on your **"meldra"** project

2. **Redeploy Latest:**
   - Go to **"Deployments"** tab
   - Click **"..."** menu (three dots) on the latest deployment
   - Click **"Redeploy"**
   - **IMPORTANT:** Make sure it says "Redeploy from GitHub" or shows commit `871b164`
   - Click **"Redeploy"**

3. **Wait for Build:**
   - Status: "Building" → "Ready"
   - Time: 2-3 minutes

4. **Verify:**
   - Visit your site: `https://insight.meldra.ai` or your Vercel URL
   - Should show the Landing page with "meldra" and "Data Made Simple"

---

### **Option 3: Create New Deployment from Latest Commit**

If redeploy doesn't work:

1. **Go to Vercel Dashboard:**
   - [vercel.com/dashboard](https://vercel.com/dashboard)
   - Click on your project

2. **Create New Deployment:**
   - Click **"Deployments"** tab
   - Click **"Create Deployment"** button (top right)
   - Select **"main"** branch
   - Make sure it shows commit `871b164` or latest
   - Click **"Deploy"**

3. **Wait for Build:**
   - Status: "Building" → "Ready"
   - Time: 2-3 minutes

## 🔍 Verify Landing Page is Working

After deployment completes:

1. **Visit Your Site:**
   - Go to: `https://insight.meldra.ai` or your Vercel URL
   - Should show:
     - ✅ "meldra" title (large, gradient text)
     - ✅ "Data Made Simple" tagline
     - ✅ "Privacy-First Data Analysis Platform" badge
     - ✅ "Get Started Free" and "View Pricing" buttons
     - ✅ "What Can meldra Do?" section with feature cards
     - ✅ Dark purple gradient background

2. **If Still Shows Login Page:**
   - Clear browser cache (Ctrl + Shift + R)
   - Try incognito/private window
   - Check Vercel deployment logs for errors
